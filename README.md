# Bomoda_Python

I code 5 different files using Python. The files are named according to the question.
Since for question WordCount1_a, the results are a little bit large, I record that in files, and I also upload my result files to github.
For other questions, I just print the results on the screen.

One important thing is that you should use Python2 to run the codes !!
